// The frontend's UI-only state shape and the key helpers that keep it honest.
//
// There is deliberately no exported mutable singleton any more: every write
// goes through `runtime/reducer.ts`'s single commit entry point, which owns an
// `AppState` containing exactly one `UiState` created here. What stays in this
// module is the shape, its fresh-value factories and the pure helpers
// (row keys, selection intersection) that both the reducer and the views use.
