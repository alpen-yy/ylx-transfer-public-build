//! `download` — SPIKE-PC-DOWNLOAD (pre-PC-00/PC-04 preparatory spike).
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! This is **not** the frozen PC-04 `LocalLibrary`/download engine. Per plan
//! section 16, the real port/domain shape is owned by PC-00 (freeze `F6`)
//! and the real download engine + `LocalLibrary` are PC-04, both gated
//! behind Wave 2's Pi API freeze. This spike was explicitly authorized to
//! run early (mirroring `SPIKE-PC-S3` / `SPIKE-PC-CRED` / the W0-06
//! persistence spike) because target-path safety, `.part`/journal
//! mechanics, Range-response handling, atomic commit, and crash recovery
//! (plan section 9.2 steps 2-6, section 10.3) do not require knowing Pi's
//! real wire format — only a generic [`DownloadSource`] abstraction. PC-00/
//! The production transfer coordinator now depends on this module's path,
//! Range, hash, atomic-commit, and publication-verifier contracts.
//!
//! ## Publication authenticity (plan 9.2 point 7)
//!
//! [`PublicationVerifier`] is the production seam for detached Ed25519
//! verification over the Pi's exact canonical publication payload. The
//! caller must supply the raw public key as well as the payload and
//! signature; [`commit_session`] refuses to publish whenever verification
//! fails. The concrete cryptographic implementation lives in
//! `ylx-transfer-adapters`, keeping this core crate independent of a crypto
//! backend. Test-only pass/fail fakes remain available under `cfg(test)`.
//!
//! ## What this DOES implement (plan section 9.2 steps 1-6, section 10.3)
//!
//! 1. [`derive_target_path_for_file`] — a pure, paranoid function deriving
//!    a filesystem path from opaque device/session IDs and the verified Pi
//!    publication's relative `display_path`. It rejects `..`, absolute
//!    components, empty components, UNC/drive-letter markers, NUL bytes,
//!    Windows-reserved device names, and (via
//!    [`check_case_insensitive_collision`]) case-insensitive collisions.
//!    Legacy jobs without a persisted display path safely fall back to the
//!    opaque file ID.
//! 2. A `.part` sibling file ([`part_path`]) plus a small durable sidecar
//!    journal ([`DownloadJournal`], [`journal_path`]) recording the
//!    confirmed byte offset and expected size/hash/ETag — written with the
//!    same tmp-write/fsync/rename/fsync-parent-dir pattern as the durable
//!    file helper in this module, so a corrupt or missing journal fails safe
//!    (treated as "0 confirmed"), never as trusted resume data.
//! 3. [`interpret_range_response`] / [`download_file`] handle `206` (exact
//!    `Content-Range` cross-check against the requested start), `200`
//!    fallback (never appended to an existing partial — always restarts at
//!    byte 0), `416`, `412` (ETag precondition failure), and malformed/
//!    unexpected `Content-Range` headers (hard error, never guessed at).
//!    An ETag mismatch discovered any other way (a `206` that numerically
//!    matches the requested offset but carries a different ETag than the
//!    journal remembers) is treated the same as an explicit `412`.
//!    A `416` answering a *resumed* request (`Range: bytes=N-`, `N > 0`)
//!    is not automatically fatal: it also means "there is nothing left to
//!    send", which is the truth when the local `.part` is already the
//!    whole object. That case continues to the ordinary size AND hash
//!    verification (and commits only if both pass); a partial that is not
//!    exactly the expected size is discarded and the `416` reported, and a
//!    same-size partial whose digest disagrees fails with
//!    [`DownloadError::HashMismatch`] — never a silent commit.
//! 4. [`download_file`] fsyncs the `.part` file and atomically renames it
//!    into place only after both size AND hash verify; [`commit_session`]
//!    fsyncs the session directory and only then returns a
//!    [`LocalLibraryEntry`] in [`LocalLibraryState::Committed`] — modeled
//!    as an in-memory state transition tests can observe, not a real
//!    `LocalLibrary` DB write (that is PC-01/PC-05's job — see below).
//! 5. [`recover_resume_offset`] implements the crash-recovery contract:
//!    given a `.part` file of real length `L` and a journal claiming
//!    (possibly desynced) confirmed offset `J`, the trusted resume point is
//!    always `min(L, J)`, with any excess on-disk tail beyond that point
//!    truncated before resuming.
//!
//! ## Journal granularity (a documented spike-level design choice)
//!
//! The task card allows "a simple sidecar file... or in-memory + fsync'd
//! write — your call, document it." This spike checkpoints the journal
//! **once per HTTP response, plus every [`JOURNAL_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL`]
//! bytes within a single very large response** (fsync the `.part` file's
//! new bytes, then durably rewrite the journal) rather than after every
//! single `read()` call. This is still safe under the plan's stated
//! contract even between checkpoints: [`recover_resume_offset`]'s `min(L,
//! J)` logic only ever *trusts less* than what is truly durable — a crash
//! between checkpoints costs some re-download, never data corruption or a
//! false "confirmed" claim. A real PC-04/PC-05 integrating with the actual
//! durable job schema PC-01 eventually freezes may choose a different
//! checkpoint cadence; nothing here depends on this specific interval.
//!
//! ## What is NOT implemented here (explicitly deferred)
//!
//! - **Real publication-signature verification** — see above.
//! - **Durable job-store integration.** [`DownloadJournal`] remains this
//!   module's self-contained sidecar-file journal. The transfer persistence
//!   layer owns the durable job/checkpoint rows; an integration layer may
//!   project the same fields (confirmed offset, expected size, expected
//!   SHA-256, and ETag) into that schema without changing the download
//!   protocol.
//! - **Coordinator/queue/concurrency (PC-05), production Pi HTTP client
//!   (PC-03), Tauri wiring, and any simulation/demo code.**
