//! `TransferStore` — the durable authority for transfer jobs (issue #1
//! Phase 2, commits 22–26).
//!
//! This is the store the plan's decision document names as *the* source of
//! truth for job spec, ordered file plan, per-file ledger and state/version.
//! The migration list still carries the retired `jobs`/`checkpoints` DDL so
//! existing files can be opened, but all runtime reads and writes go through
//! the `transfer_*` tables owned here.
//!
//! What this module owns:
//!
//! - **One transaction per job creation** ([`TransferStore::create_job`]).
//!   Job identity, the complete spec, the ordered files and the initial
//!   ledger are one atomic unit — a failure at any point leaves no row at
//!   all, which the `create_job_aborting_after` crash-point tests exercise
//!   directly rather than by inspection.
//! - **Request-digest verification** on an idempotent hit. Same natural key
//!   with different content is an explicit
//!   [`CreateJobError::RequestDigestMismatch`], never a silent reuse of a
//!   different file plan.
//! - **Recovery enumeration from SQLite** ([`TransferStore::
//!   list_recoverable_jobs`]) — a missing or unreadable spec becomes an
//!   observable [`RecoverableJob::Blocked`], never a silently shorter list.
//! - **The one-shot legacy importer** ([`TransferStore::
//!   import_legacy_pending_downloads`]), which reads the pending-download
//!   JSON sidecar, imports every record in one transaction, and writes a
//!   migration marker in that same transaction.
//! - **The durable completion outbox** ([`TransferStore::complete_job`],
//!   commit 29). The terminal state transition and the outcome the rest of
//!   the app has to learn about are one transaction; success, failure and
//!   cancellation all stay re-observable through
//!   [`TransferStore::pending_completions`] until
//!   [`TransferStore::acknowledge_completion`] stamps them.
