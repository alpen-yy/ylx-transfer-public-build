//! SQLite schema and migrations for the durable transfer store.
//!
//! **Status: pre-PC-00/PC-01 spike, explicitly out-of-sequence-authorized**
//! (see the task card that produced this file). W0-06 (`sqlite_store.rs`)
//! already answered the *engine* question (SQLite over JSON) with a
//! generic whole-snapshot `library_entries`/`storage_config` KV store. This
//! module goes one level more concrete: the actual multi-table schema the
//! real PC-01 deliverable needs for the tagged transfer-job state machine
//! (plan section 5.4), the download commit protocol (section 9.2), and the
//! S3 upload receipt (section 9.3).
//!
//! This schema is provisional. It has **not** been reviewed against the
//! real domain model, because that domain model does not exist yet — PC-00
//! (core scaffold, tagged Device/Connection/Transfer/Local/Backup enums)
//! has not run. Once PC-00 freezes the real types, PC-01 should treat this
//! file as a starting draft to revise, not a frozen contract. In
//! particular:
//!
//! - `device_id` / `session_id` / `file_id` are plain `TEXT` here (matching
//!   W0-06's existing `LibraryEntryRecord` convention in `snapshot.rs`),
//!   not `domain::DeviceId`/`SessionId` newtypes — this module deliberately
//!   does not depend on `crate::domain` (PC-00's territory) or
//!   `crate::library` (SPIKE-PC-DOWNLOAD's territory) to avoid coupling a
//!   spike to other in-flight spikes' internal shapes.
//! - "storage profile" (S3 provider/bucket/endpoint) is **not** duplicated
//!   here — it already exists as `sqlite_store::MIGRATIONS`'s
//!   `storage_config` table. This spike only adds the five tables its task
//!   card lists by name: `library`, `files`, `jobs`, `checkpoints`,
//!   `receipts`.
//! - The job-state transition graph in this file (`is_valid_transition`)
//!   is a reasonable, documented *first draft* covering the tagged enum in
//!   plan section 5.4, not a graph PC-05 (the real coordinator) has signed
//!   off on.
//!
//! ## No secrets in this schema
//!
//! None of the tables below have a column for a raw token, password, or S3
//! secret key. `checkpoints.expected_etag` and `receipts.evidence` store
//! *server-observed, non-secret* identifiers (an HTTP ETag, an S3 version
//! ID, a HEAD-response digest) — proof that a transfer happened, never a
//! credential that could authenticate a new request. Raw credentials stay
//! in SPIKE-PC-CRED's vault (`credential_vault.rs`); only opaque
//! non-secret references belong here, matching ADR-PC-001's "Secrets ...
//! never get a column in this schema" consequence. See
//! `journal_spike::schema_has_no_secret_columns` for the machine-checked
//! version of this claim.

/// Ordered, forward-only migrations for the transfer database. Versions
/// 1-5 are retained as compatibility DDL for files created by the retired
/// journal implementation; current runtime reads and writes use the
/// `transfer_*` tables added by version 6 and later. Each entry is applied at
/// most once, tracked in `schema_migrations`, inside its own transaction.
///
/// Split into five single-table versions (rather than one big v1) so the
/// migration tests have real intermediate versions to exercise, not just
/// v0 -> v1.
