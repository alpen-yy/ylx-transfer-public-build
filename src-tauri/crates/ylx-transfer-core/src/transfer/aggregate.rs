//! Issue #1 phase 3, commits 37–40: the **one** domain state model, the
//! pure `JobAggregate` reducer, expected-version CAS, and the atomic
//! [`JobSnapshot`].
//!
//! # Commit 37 — one state model, one transition graph
//!
//! [`TransferJobState`] (in `transfer::mod`) is the vertex set;
//! [`is_legal_transition`] in this module is the **edge set**, and it is
//! the only definition of "which transitions are legal" this codebase
//! reasons about. `persistence` is allowed to encode a *state tag* and a
//! *version* for a row — nothing more. `persistence::schema::
//! is_valid_transition` still exists (that module is owned elsewhere and
//! is scheduled for deletion by its owner), so this module pins it down
//! with an exhaustive 13x13 equivalence test: if the persistence copy ever
//! disagrees with this graph by a single edge, that test fails. There is
//! therefore no second, independently-evolvable state graph.
//!
//! # Commit 38 — the reducer is pure
//!
//! [`JobAggregate::decide`] takes the current state (plus version and
//! desired run state) and one [`JobCommand`], and returns a [`Decision`]:
//! an outcome plus an ordered list of [`Effect`]s for someone else to
//! perform. It opens no database, makes no network call, spawns no thread
//! and reads no clock — which is what makes the exhaustive state x command
//! table below possible at all.
//!
//! # Commit 39 — expected-version CAS
//!
//! Every durable transition the reducer proposes is an
//! [`Effect::Commit`] carrying the exact `expected_version` it was decided
//! against. A performer that finds a different version must report a stale
//! result (see `CoordinatorError::Stale`) instead of overwriting the state
//! another command already committed. A chain of commits inside one
//! decision (`cancelling` then `cancelled`) carries strictly increasing
//! expected versions, so replaying half a chain cannot silently succeed.
//!
//! # Commit 40 — one snapshot, one version
//!
//! [`JobSnapshot`] carries identity, state, desired run state, progress
//! and error together with the `version` they were all read at, so callers
//! stop stitching a job's view together from several reads that can
//! disagree.
