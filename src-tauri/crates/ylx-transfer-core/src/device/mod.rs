//! PC-00 device state — plan section 5.4's three *orthogonal* device state
//! domains, as real Rust enums.
//!
//! Plan section 5.4 (translated): "设备的三个状态域必须正交" ("a device's
//! three state domains must be orthogonal") — discovery, connection, and
//! capture activity are independent axes, not one combined state machine.
//! [`Device`] combines all three (plus identity) into one struct, but each
//! axis's enum can only ever hold values for its own domain: it is a
//! *compile* error, not a runtime validation failure, to try to construct
//! e.g. a "connected" state carrying a pairing `attempt_id` — see the
//! `tests` module for that property demonstrated directly.
//!
//! This is the real replacement for the W0-06 `DeviceStub` placeholder
//! that used to live here; [`crate::transfer::TransferJobState`] is the
//! sibling per-job enum PC-02/PC-05 build actor/coordinator logic on top
//! of.
