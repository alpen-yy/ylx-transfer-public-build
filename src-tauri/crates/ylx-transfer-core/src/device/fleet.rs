//! `DeviceFleet` — per-device actor handles, so the registry lock stops
//! being a global serialization point for every device (issue #1, commits
//! 57 and 58).
//!
//! # The problem this replaces
//!
//! The `DeviceActorRegistry` this replaced (deleted in commit 59) handed
//! out `&mut DeviceActor` borrows, which means a caller could only reach a
//! device's actor *while holding the registry itself*. In practice that
//! registry lived behind one process-wide `Mutex`, so the borrow forced every
//! caller to serialize on a single lock — and, worse, network I/O issued
//! through that borrow (`actor.heartbeat_with(client)`,
//! `actor.refresh_capture_activity_with(client)`) runs *inside* the critical
//! section. One slow or unreachable Pi therefore stalls every other
//! device's heartbeat, pairing, catalog listing, delete, disconnect and
//! transfer-readiness check — the exact opposite of plan section 16's
//! "一台设备故障不阻塞其他设备 actor".
//!
//! # The shape here
//!
//! A [`DeviceFleet`] owns `Mutex<HashMap<DeviceFingerprint, DeviceHandle>>`,
//! and that lock is held for exactly one thing: **look up or insert a
//! handle**. Every unit of per-device work then happens behind that
//! device's own [`DeviceHandle`], which is an `Arc` with its own lock and
//! no path back to the map. Two consequences fall out structurally rather
//! than by convention:
//!
//! - A handle cannot hold the registry lock, because it does not have one
//!   to hold.
//! - Per-device network I/O ([`DeviceHandle::heartbeat_with`],
//!   [`DeviceHandle::poll_pairing_with`], [`DeviceHandle::refresh_capture_activity_with`],
//!   [`DeviceHandle::delete_session_with`]) is written as *copy inputs under the
//!   handle lock → drop the lock → do the I/O → re-acquire and apply*, so
//!   even that per-device lock is not held across a network call.
//!
//! # Identity is the full fingerprint
//!
//! The map key is [`DeviceFingerprint`], the device's **whole** TLS
//! fingerprint. The short `YLX-XXXXXXXX` form the UI shows is a
//! *projection* ([`DeviceFingerprint::short_display_id`]) available on any
//! snapshot for display DTOs — never the identity. Truncating to eight hex
//! characters leaves ~2^32 possibilities, so two genuinely different
//! devices can share a short id; keying the map on it would silently merge
//! them into one actor, one session and one bearer token. See
//! `two_devices_with_colliding_short_ids_stay_distinct`.
//!
//! # Fencing (commit 58)
//!
//! Doing the I/O outside every lock means a reply can arrive after the
//! world moved on: the device may have been disconnected and re-paired, or
//! a newer heartbeat may already have been issued. Every off-lock operation
//! therefore takes a fencing token *before* the call
//! ([`HeartbeatTicket`], [`EpochTicket`]) and is only applied if that token
//! is still current when the reply comes back:
//!
//! - epoch — the connection generation the request was issued under
//!   (already enforced by [`DeviceActor::apply_heartbeat_result`]);
//! - attempt — a per-handle monotonic counter, so that even *within* one
//!   epoch a reply belonging to a superseded heartbeat attempt is dropped
//!   rather than applied.
//!
//! Pairing is fenced by `attempt_id` instead of by epoch (a pairing device
//! is not connected yet, so there is no epoch), which
//! [`DeviceActor::apply_pairing_status`] already implements.
