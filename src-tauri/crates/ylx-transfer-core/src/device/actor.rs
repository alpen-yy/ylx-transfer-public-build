//! PC-02 per-device actor: owns one [`Device`]'s full connection lifecycle
//! (pairing, heartbeat, disconnect, capture-activity refresh),
//! independent of every other device's actor -- plan section 16 "PC-02
//! Per-device actor 与 connection lifecycle" ("一台设备故障不阻塞其他设备
//! actor", "a fault on one device must never block another device's
//! actor").
//!
//! # Why capability ports instead of depending on adapters directly
//!
//! This crate (`ylx-transfer-core`) has zero dependency on `tauri`,
//! `reqwest`, or any network crate (see the crate root doc comment) --
//! `ylx-transfer-adapters` depends on `ylx-transfer-core`, never the
//! reverse. The small capability traits below are therefore the seams: the
//! actor depends only on the operation it is performing, and the adapters
//! crate implements those traits for its real HTTP client. This module never
//! references `PiHttpClient` or `PiHttpError` by name; tests inject focused
//! fake capability implementations instead of a real network client.
//!
//! # Connection epoch
//!
//! [`ConnectionState::Connected`] carries an `epoch` (see
//! `crate::device` module docs). Every successful pairing-to-connected
//! transition here allocates a fresh epoch (a simple monotonically
//! increasing counter -- the Pi wire protocol has no epoch concept of its
//! own to reuse). [`DeviceActor::apply_heartbeat_result`] is the
//! staleness guard: it takes the epoch the caller observed when it
//! *issued* the heartbeat request, and refuses to mutate state if the
//! actor has since moved to a different epoch (e.g. disconnected and
//! reconnected while that request was in flight) -- exactly the "old
//! epoch callback ignored" property plan section 16 requires.
//! [`DeviceActor::apply_pairing_status`] applies the analogous guard for
//! pairing polls, keyed by `attempt_id` instead (a device is not
//! connected yet, so there is no epoch to key on): a poll response for an
//! `attempt_id` that no longer matches the actor's current pairing
//! attempt is stale and ignored, so an old (superseded) pairing attempt
//! resolving late can never corrupt a newer attempt's state.
//!
//! # Token secrecy
//!
//! The Pi's one-shot `connection_token` (bearer credential for
//! authenticated calls) is moved directly into [`AuthenticatedPiSession`].
//! That session uses [`Secret`]'s redacted `Debug` implementation and travels
//! through authenticated capability ports together with its TLS pin,
//! publication identity, and connection epoch. The actor never stores or
//! returns a second raw-token representation.
