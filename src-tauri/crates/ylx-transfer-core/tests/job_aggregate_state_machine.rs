//! Issue #1 commits 37–38, from the outside: the transfer job state
//! machine and its reducer are usable — and provable — without a database,
//! a network, a thread or a clock.
//!
//! The in-crate unit tests pin the full state x command table. This file
//! is the *external* contract: everything a consumer needs to reason about
//! a job is reachable through the public API, the reducer is pure, and the
//! four invariants the refactor plan names hold for every state and every
//! command.
