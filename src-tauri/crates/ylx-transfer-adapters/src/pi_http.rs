//! `PiHttpClient` -- PC-03's real HTTPS client for the Pi transfer-daemon
//! (plan section 16 "PC-03 Pi HTTPS 与 mDNS adapters", wire contract frozen
//! by plan section 10.2 / `capture/docs/transfer-api/v1/openapi.json` in
//! the sibling RP-YLX repo).
//!
//! This is a **real** client against a **real** server: the Pi-side
//! `ylx-transferd` daemon (`capture/src/ylx_capture/transfer_daemon_cli.py`
//! in RP-YLX, composed by `capture/src/ylx_capture/transfer/composition.py`)
//! already exists, already runs, and already has its own end-to-end test
//! suite (`capture/tests/test_transfer_daemon_e2e.py`). Every endpoint path,
//! status code, and JSON shape below was verified against that daemon's own
//! handler source (`capture/src/ylx_capture/transfer/http_handlers.py`),
//! its OpenAPI document, and its `tests/transfer-api/v1/fixtures/**`
//! fixtures -- not guessed from prose. `tests/pi_http_integration.rs` in
//! this crate spawns the real Python daemon as a subprocess and proves a
//! real cross-language wire round trip; see that file's module doc comment
//! for exactly what is and is not covered.
//!
//! # TLS: fingerprint pinning, not full CA validation (deliberate, v1 scope)
//!
//! The Pi daemon's TLS certificate is self-signed per device
//! (`capture/src/ylx_capture/transfer/tls_identity.py`, ADR-SEC-002): there
//! is no CA to chain-validate against, by design -- the trust anchor is
//! meant to be the human-verified SAS (Short Authentication String) at
//! pairing time, not a certificate authority. This client's [`PiTlsPin`]
//! therefore pins the exact SHA-256 hash of the certificate's DER-encoded
//! SubjectPublicKeyInfo (SPKI) -- the *same* value and the *same hash
//! input* `tls_identity.compute_fingerprint` computes on the Pi side (only
//! the SPKI substructure is hashed, never the whole certificate DER, so the
//! fingerprint survives a cert reissue that keeps the same key). A caller
//! obtains this fingerprint out of band (the pairing/SAS flow -- not
//! implemented by this task, PC-02/PC-07's job -- or a value passed in
//! directly, e.g. hard-coded for a dev/test daemon).
//!
//! Concretely: `PinnedFingerprintVerifier` implements
//! `rustls::client::danger::ServerCertVerifier` and accepts a server
//! certificate *iff* its SPKI's SHA-256 matches the configured pin --
//! skipping both hostname/SAN checks and CA chain-of-trust validation
//! entirely (there is no CA to validate against). It still cryptographically
//! verifies the TLS handshake signature (`verify_tls12_signature`/
//! `verify_tls13_signature`, delegated to `rustls::crypto`'s own WebPKI
//! signature-verification routines) -- this is *not* the same as
//! `disable_verification(true)`, which would accept **any** certificate
//! with **no** cryptographic check at all. `ureq`'s own `TlsConfig` only
//! exposes `disable_verification`/a fixed root-cert list, neither of which
//! expresses "pin by fingerprint, skip hostname" -- so this module plugs a
//! bespoke `Connector`/rustls `ClientConfig` directly into `ureq` via
//! `Agent::with_parts` (a documented, if "not yet semver-stable",
//! `ureq::unversioned` extension point) rather than working around that gap
//! with a weaker setting. See `DEPENDENCY_REQUEST.md` for the
//! `rustls`/`rustls-webpki` additions this required.
//!
//! Because hostname/SAN checks are skipped, this client dials the Pi
//! directly by IP:port (exactly like the real Python E2E test's
//! `http.client.HTTPSConnection("127.0.0.1", port, ...)` does) -- no
//! DNS/mDNS-name-to-TLS-SNI trick is needed or attempted.
//!
//! # No auto-follow redirects
//!
//! The Pi server never sends a redirect in v1, but this client does not
//! silently follow one if it ever did: the underlying `ureq` agent is
//! configured with `max_redirects(0)`, so any 3xx response is returned to
//! the caller as an ordinary (non-2xx) status, mapped the same way any
//! other unexpected status is (see [`PiHttpError::UnexpectedStatus`]).
//!
//! # Error mapping
//!
//! Every non-2xx response is expected to be `application/problem+json`
//! (plan 10.4 / `capture/docs/transfer-api/v1/schemas/problem.schema.json`).
//! [`PiApiErrorCode`] mirrors the wire `code` registry exactly (verified
//! against `capture/src/ylx_capture/transfer/models.py`'s
//! `TransferErrorCode` enum, the Pi-side source of truth) and callers MUST
//! branch on it, never on `detail` (a free-form human string) -- matching
//! the schema's own documented contract. A response that claims a non-2xx
//! status but does not actually parse as a problem+json body (e.g. a
//! misbehaving/incompatible server, or the deliberately-untouched
//! redirect-not-followed case above) becomes
//! [`PiHttpError::UnexpectedStatus`] rather than panicking or silently
//! discarding the body.
//!
//! This module deliberately does not reuse `ylx_transfer_core::transfer::
//! FailureCode` for wire errors: that enum is PC-00's *job-scoped* failure
//! classification (network/disk-full/hash-mismatch/object-store-rejected/
//! device-heartbeat-failed -- a coordinator-level concept), not a mirror of
//! the Pi's wire error registry (invalid_request/session_in_use/
//! revision_mismatch/etc, an HTTP-protocol-scoped concept) -- collapsing
//! the two would lose exactly the distinction PC-00's own module doc
//! comment on `TransferJobState::Failed` warns against. It *does* reuse
//! [`ylx_transfer_core::domain::{SessionId, FileId}`] (path parameters) and
//! [`ylx_transfer_core::device::{CaptureActivityState, PairingPhase}`]
//! (wire enums that already match verbatim) wherever the wire shape and the
//! core domain type genuinely coincide.
