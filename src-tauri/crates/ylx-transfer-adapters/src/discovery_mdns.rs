//! `MdnsDiscovery` -- PC-03's mDNS candidate browser for
//! `_ylx-capture._tcp.local.` (plan section 16 "PC-03 Pi HTTPS 与 mDNS
//! adapters").
//!
//! # Scope: deliberately minimal (this task's own brief)
//!
//! The task card is explicit that this side should stay small: PI-06 (the
//! Pi-side advertiser, `capture/src/ylx_capture/transfer/discovery.py`'s
//! `ZeroconfMdnsRegistrar` in the sibling RP-YLX repo) already proved the
//! wire protocol works; this module only needs to browse for it and hand
//! back a list of *candidates* -- it does not attempt resolution retry
//! policy, TTL/staleness tracking beyond "did we see a removal event", or
//! any kind of ranking/preference logic. A future task can build that on
//! top of [`MdnsDiscovery::poll_events`]'s output if/when it's actually
//! needed.
//!
//! # mDNS is discovery-only, never a trust anchor (ADR-DISC-001)
//!
//! Every [`MdnsCandidate`] this module produces is **unauthenticated**:
//! its `device_id`/name/IP/TXT record are exactly what showed up on the
//! local network claiming to be `_ylx-capture._tcp.local.`, which anyone
//! on the same LAN segment can spoof. Nothing in this module (or anywhere
//! else in this crate) may treat a candidate as a paired/trusted device on
//! the strength of this data alone -- the only thing that establishes
//! trust is the SAS-verified pairing flow (`pi_http.rs`'s
//! `create_pairing_request`/TLS fingerprint pin), which a caller drives
//! separately using the `host`/`port` this module surfaces as *inputs* to
//! attempt, never as an identity to accept outright. This module's own
//! type names deliberately say "candidate", not "device", to keep that
//! distinction visible at every call site.
//!
//! # Lifecycle: tagged poll outcomes + RAII shutdown
//!
//! Two lifecycle hazards used to be invisible here and are now modelled
//! explicitly:
//!
//! 1. **A dead browser is not the same as a quiet one.** [`Self::poll`]
//!    used to return `0` both when no event was pending (normal, keep
//!    polling) and when the browse channel had been torn down (the daemon
//!    thread is gone; polling can only ever return `0` again). A caller
//!    driving a `loop { poll(); sleep(); }` would then spin forever on a
//!    daemon that will never speak again. [`MdnsDiscovery::poll_events`]
//!    returns a tagged [`PollOutcome`] instead: [`PollOutcome::Idle`],
//!    [`PollOutcome::Events`], or [`PollOutcome::Disconnected`], the last
//!    of which is a *stop polling* instruction (see
//!    [`PollOutcome::is_disconnected`]).
//! 2. **Stopping the browse must not depend on the happy path.**
//!    Teardown lives in [`BrowseGuard`]'s `Drop`, so the browse is stopped
//!    and the daemon shut down even when the caller drops
//!    [`MdnsDiscovery`] without calling [`MdnsDiscovery::stop`], or when
//!    the poll loop unwinds through a panic. A teardown failure is
//!    returned from [`MdnsDiscovery::stop`] when the caller asked for it,
//!    and logged to stderr when it happens during an implicit drop --
//!    never silently swallowed into a leaked daemon thread.
//!
//! # Real multicast mDNS: not exercised end-to-end in this sandbox
//!
//! [`MdnsDiscovery::start`] constructs a real `mdns-sd` `ServiceDaemon` and
//! issues a real `browse()` call -- this is not a fake. However, this
//! sandbox environment's network namespace was not verified to support
//! real multicast (no actual `_ylx-capture._tcp.local.` advertiser was
//! reachable to resolve against; PI-06's advertiser lives in a different
//! process/repo and was not run alongside this task). The tests in this
//! module therefore split into two honest categories: (1) real,
//! non-`#[ignore]`d unit tests of the pure `ServiceInfo` -> [`MdnsCandidate`]
//! mapping, the URL-composition helpers, and the poll/teardown state
//! machine driven through an in-memory [`BrowseTransport`] -- none of
//! which needs a network at all; and (2) an `#[ignore]`d
//! `real_daemon_starts_and_can_be_stopped` smoke test that *does* start a
//! real daemon and issue a real `browse()`, run manually
//! (`cargo test -p ylx-transfer-adapters --lib discovery_mdns -- --ignored`)
//! rather than in the default suite, so a sandbox/CI runner without
//! multicast support does not get a flaky/hanging default test run. See
//! that test's own doc comment for exactly what it does and does not
//! prove.
